### Hi 👋

I'm Luke, a UI developer living in Newry, Ireland 🇮🇪. Currently I am at [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com), helping to build out our institutional offering.

I have a passion for all things frontend, whether it's writing application code using React or Svelte, building out design systems with stitches, E2E testing with Cypress, or configuring and optimising CI pipelines - I love getting my hands dirty wherever I can.

#### Current projects

Automating repetetive tasks, and improving developer experience is really important to me. I'm working on a few projects in this area:

- 📋 [gqlshare](https://gqlshare.dev) - simplify sharing GraphQL queries with your team for QA or debugging
- 🧵 Pulley - visualise the state of your teams outstanding pull requests, with an aim to improving review & merge turnaround
- 🏠 [unnamed] - bring your wireframes & GraphQL schema together for better collaboration & planning in your team
